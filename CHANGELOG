Things to do:

Procedure for file transfer:

	Client to Server:
		retrieve files, place in tar, copy to destination folder via
		ssh
		
		server:
		uncompress tarball, gzip all files, tar the compressed files
		remove old backups if differential is enabled
	
	Server to client:
		To speed up file transfer:
		Client copies data to itself, extracts the tarball, extracts
		gzip files, move to desired location.

Issues:
(RESOLVED) Daemon removes leading /
	Solution: remove preservation options, the rest will be resolved in
	the restoration scripts.

Create recovery option
	Solution: Recovery will consist of the following steps:
	MBU will invoke daemon with option to update directory list
	MBU will copy list to setup dir
	MBU will append incrementing numbers to list
	MBU will read list into setup
	MBU will start setup
	setup will ask user to choose backup files
	setup will ask user if they want to choose individual files
	ask user which recovery method to use
		absolute recovery (add selective option?)
		selective recovery (isolated)
	setup will call filemanager with aproprate options
	filemanager will send file list to client if requested
		filemanager will start choice.sh
		choice will ask user for desired files
		choice will write these to a file
	setup will call filemanager with -r and the approprate options to
	recover files
	filemanager will untar backup files
	filemanager will ungzip backup files
	filemanager will copy tarred file to client (location determined by
	absolute or isolated backup)
		if absolute, copy to client's root directory
		if selective, copy to designated folder
	filemanager will extract the archive
	filemanager will clean temp directory
	filemanager will clean tar file


Test SSH features
	connect to personal accounts and confirm SSH functions

Allow user to manually run daemon, and/or backup
	Solution: daemon can be run at any time without options
	backup will have to be able to take options to determine which kind of
	backup to create and temporarily disable time constraints

Add ability to view contents of archive
	Solution: have a list menu, updated by the daemon, allow user to
	select (one?) archive, and list the contents.

Add ability to select which files in a archive to recover and which method
	Solution: Sub catagory of recovery option...
	use tar to view contents of selected archive, will use components of
	view archive. then pass through sed to remove .gz extentions from
	list, selection will be a checklist, then offer option to recover
	absolutly or islolated recovery. Then extract, uncompress, tar, copy
	to client specified by absolute or isolated option, uncompress, clean
	server files.

Use daemon to update backup and setup scripts
	daemon will update and run all services
	update will consist of writing directory contents to setup script
	(primary) in addition, it will run the server file manager discribed
	later. 
	
Rename files
	Daemon: runs and updates all appropriate scripts on time, if setup is
	run, run daemon
	
	filemanager: creates tarballs, removes tarred files, removes excess
	files and directories, manages serverside backup and recovery options
	
	setup: Coordinates all HID actions, preventing user interference.

Add option to read backup directory list from file
